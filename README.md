# Speech Recognition with Wav2Vec 2.0

Welcome to the Speech Recognition project using Wav2Vec 2.0! This project focuses on transcribing spoken language into text using Wav2Vec 2.0.

## Project Overview

Speech recognition involves converting spoken language into text. This project uses the Wav2Vec 2.0 model from Hugging Face's transformers library to perform speech-to-text tasks. The dataset used can be any collection of audio files and their corresponding transcriptions.
